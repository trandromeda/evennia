    This is the base class for all non-player entities, including monsters. These
    generally don't advance in level but uses a simplified, abstract measure of how
    dangerous or competent they are - the 'hit dice' (HD).

    HD indicates how much health they have and how hard they hit. In _Knave_, HD also
    defaults to being the bonus for all abilities. HP is 4 x Hit die (this can then be
    customized per-entity of course).

    Morale is set explicitly per-NPC, usually between 7 and 9.

    Monsters don't use equipment in the way PCs do, instead they have a fixed armor
    value, and their Abilities are dynamically generated from the HD (hit_dice).

    If wanting monsters or NPCs that can level and work the same as PCs, base them off the
    EvAdventureCharacter class instead.

    The weapon of the npc is stored as an Attribute instead of implementing a full
    inventory/equipment system. This means that the normal inventory can be used for
    non-combat purposes (or for loot to get when killing an enemy).
